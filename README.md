# Lambda Calculus Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various lambda calculi. The goal in these implementations is:
 * Implemented in a theorem prover - current choice is Lean though I have experimented with Agda and Coq.
 * Prove interesting properties about the language, in particular, type safety and strong normalization.
 * Hopefully continue to learn about type theories and gradually increase the scope of my knowledge until I can implement a novel programming language to some degree.

Right now, the plan is to proceed through the [PFPL](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl.html) book and gradually implement the various languages mentioned within. These are the languages I have implemented so far, please click the links for more information on each.
